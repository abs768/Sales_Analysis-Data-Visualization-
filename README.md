# Data-Visualization using kaggle's Dataset-https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kiliantscherny/sales-data-for-a-tech-shop?resource=download

# About
Data Visualization is a concept of representing a given dataset into visual forms as like  : bar graphs,pie chart,boxes and whiskers etc.

# Sales_Analysis

The respository currently in use is based on how to solve real life problems using pandas and how can we visualize them in different forms using matplotlib.

So, here we take a dataset read it with the help of pandas function read_csv('title') and analyse the sales pattern from april 2019- september 2019.
Based on the description we make bar graphs and various line styles we can see the dataset in the form of eye appealing diagrams.
Then, based upon it we can solve and get the answers to the sales questions like:

Question 1: What was the best month for sales? How much was earned that month?

Question 2: What city sold the most product?

Question 3: What time should we display advertisements to maximize likelihood of customer's buying product?

Question 4: What products are most often sold together?

Question 5: What product sold the most? Why do you think it sold the most?

## Usage of matplotlib:

Example:

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

xpoints = np.array([0, 6])
ypoints = np.array([0, 250])

plt.plot(xpoints, ypoints)
plt.show()
